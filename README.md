# 8 Puzzle Problem


The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. 

It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square. 

The following shows a sequence of legal moves from an initial board position (left) to the goal position (right).
